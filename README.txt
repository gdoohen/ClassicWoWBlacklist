Hi there, this is a fan project I made for a game, World of Warcraft - Classic Edition. The website was public rating system of players that anyone could participate in. The value of such a system, when not abused, was to lookup a player and get a sense for the experience other players have had with them in the past.

I made this website in Mid-Late 2019. I would do some things differently:

1) I would use a severless backend, possibly with GraphQL, I currently like Netlify a lot.
    - If I didn't go with serverless for whatever reason I would use NextJS to handle everything instead of a separate Express server.
2) I would use Emotion/Styled on the Front End for better CSS.
3) I would use a CMS on the backend to store a few static .json data files I had.
